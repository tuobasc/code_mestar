{"name": "4391", "description": "## The Story\nGreen Lantern's long hours of study and practice with his ring have really paid off -- his skills, focus, and control have improved so much that now he can even use his ring to update and redesign his web site. Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed\n\n~~~~\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nThere's nothing cooler than my site!\n~~~~\n\nin his favorite font in very large blinking green letters.\n\nThe problem is, Green Lantern's ring has no power over anything yellow, so if he's experimenting with his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn't actually know any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.\n\n## Your Mission\nYou can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here's the plan to get version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:\n\nYour function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code. (You're not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don't think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don't know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"lemonchiffon\"    \"PaleGreen\"\n\"GOLD\"            \"ForestGreen\"\n\"pAlEgOlDeNrOd\"   \"LightGreen\"\n\"BlueViolet\"      \"BlueViolet\"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don't know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color's red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as \"yellow\" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these \"yellow\" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"#000000\"   \"#000000\"\n\"#b8860b\"   \"#0bb886\"\n\"#8FBC8F\"   \"#8FBC8F\"\n\"#C71585\"   \"#C71585\"\n```", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 4391, "sample_io": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "starter_code": "\ndef yellow_be_gone(s):\n\t"}

However, you recently contracted a sickness that forced you to stay at home for over a week.

Replace *all* instances of ```\"going to\"``` to ```\"gonna\"```\n6. Replace *all* instances of ```\"combination\"``` to ```\"combo\"```\n\nYour replacement regexes **should be case-sensitive**, only replacing the words above with slang if the detected pattern is in **lowercase**.  However, please note that apart from 100% lowercase matches, you will **also have to replace matches that are correctly capitalized** (e.g. ```\"Probably\" => \"Prolly\"``` or ```\"Instagram\" => \"Insta\"```).\n\nFinally, your code will be tested to make sure that you have used **RegExp** replace in your code.\n\nEnjoy :D", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 3884, "sample_io": [{"input": "Probably", "output": ["Prolly"]}, {"input": "Instagram", "output": ["Insta"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "When I miss few days of gym", "output": ["When I miss few days of gym"]}, {"input": "Squad probably think I am fake", "output": ["Squad prolly think I'm fake"]}, {"input": "Whole squad probably bigger than me now", "output": ["Whole squad prolly bigger than me now"]}, {"input": "No selfie to post on Instagram either", "output": ["No selfie to post on Insta either"]}, {"input": "Gym crush probably found someone else", "output": ["Gym crush prolly found someone else"]}, {"input": "What if I die fat", "output": ["What if I die fat"]}, {"input": "What if I do not fit in my clothes now", "output": ["What if I don't fit in my clothes now"]}, {"input": "Going to feel like a new gym member", "output": ["Gonna feel like a new gym member"]}, {"input": "wait what was my lock combination", "output": ["wait what was my lock combo"]}, {"input": "that skinny girl can probably outlift me now", "output": ["that skinny girl can prolly outlift me now"]}, {"input": "probably Probably", "output": ["prolly Prolly"]}, {"input": "i am I am", "output": ["i'm I'm"]}, {"input": "instagram Instagram", "output": ["insta Insta"]}, {"input": "do not Do not", "output": ["don't Don't"]}, {"input": "going to Going to", "output": ["gonna Gonna"]}, {"input": "combination Combination", "output": ["combo Combo"]}, {"input": "probably Probably probably Probably probably Probably probably Probably probably Probably", "output": ["prolly Prolly prolly Prolly prolly Prolly prolly Prolly prolly Prolly"]}, {"input": "i am I am i am I am i am I am i am I am i am I am i am I am", "output": ["i'm I'm i'm I'm i'm I'm i'm I'm i'm I'm i'm I'm"]}, {"input": "instagram Instagram instagram Instagram instagram Instagram instagram Instagram instagram Instagram", "output": ["insta Insta insta Insta insta Insta insta Insta insta Insta"]}, {"input": "do not Do not do not Do not do not Do not do not Do not", "output": ["don't Don't don't Don't don't Don't don't Don't"]}, {"input": "Going to going to Going to Going to going to Going to Going to going to Going to", "output": ["Gonna gonna Gonna Gonna gonna Gonna Gonna gonna Gonna"]}, {"input": "combination combination Combination combination Combination", "output": ["combo combo Combo combo Combo"]}], "starter_code": "\ndef gym_slang(phrase):\n\t"}
{"name": "1654", "description": "To give credit where credit is due: This problem was taken from the ACMICPC-Northwest Regional Programming Contest. Thank you problem writers.\n\nYou are helping an archaeologist decipher some runes. He knows that this ancient society used a Base 10 system, and that they never start a number with a leading zero. He's figured out most of the digits as well as a few operators, but he needs your help to figure out the rest.\n\nThe professor will give you a simple math expression, of the form\n\n```\n[number][op][number]=[number]\n```\n\nHe has converted all of the runes he knows into digits. The only operators he knows are addition (`+`),subtraction(`-`), and multiplication (`*`), so those are the only ones that will appear. Each number will be in the range from -1000000 to 1000000, and will consist of only the digits 0-9, possibly a leading -, and maybe a few ?s. If there are ?s in an expression, they represent a digit rune that the professor doesn't know (never an operator, and never a leading -). All of the ?s in an expression will represent the same digit (0-9), and it won't be one of the other given digits in the expression. No number will begin with a 0 unless the number itself is  0, therefore 00 would not be a valid number. \n\nGiven an expression, figure out the value of the rune represented by the question mark. If more than one digit works, give the lowest one. If no digit works, well, that's bad news for the professor - it means that he's got some of his runes wrong. output -1 in that case.\n\nComplete the method to solve the expression to find the value of the unknown rune. The method takes a string as a paramater repressenting the expression and will return an int value representing the unknown rune or -1 if no such rune exists.\n\n~~~if:php\n**Most of the time, the professor will be able to figure out most of the runes himself, but sometimes, there may be exactly 1 rune present in the expression that the professor cannot figure out (resulting in all question marks where the digits are in the expression) so be careful ;)**\n~~~", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1654, "sample_io": [], "test_list": [{"input": "123?45*?=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?*123?45=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "??605*-63=-73???5", "output": [1]}, {"input": "123?45+?=123?45", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?8?170-1?6256=7?2?14", "output": [9]}, {"input": "?38???+595???=833444", "output": [2]}, {"input": "123?45-?=123?45", "output": [0]}, {"input": "-7715?5--484?00=-28?9?5", "output": [6]}, {"input": "50685?--1?5630=652?8?", "output": [4]}, {"input": "??+??=??", "output": [-1]}, {"input": "-?56373--9216=-?47157", "output": [8]}], "starter_code": "\ndef solve_runes(runes):\n\t"}

He has already made n tasks, for each task the boy evaluated how interesting it is as an integer q_{i}, and the time t_{i} in minutes needed to complete the task. \n\nAn interesting feature of his quest is: each participant should get the task that is best suited for him, depending on his preferences. The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with \"yes\" or \"no\". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks. \n\nWe know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than T minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the n tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most T minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task. Each task can only be used once (i.e., the people who give different answers to questions should get different tasks).\n\nPolycarp wants the total \"interest\" value of the tasks involved in the quest to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum possible total interest value of the task considering that the quest should be completed in T minutes at any variant of answering questions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and T (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of tasks made by Polycarp and the maximum time a quest player should fit into.\n\nNext n lines contain two integers t_{i}, q_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ T, 1 ≤ q_{i} ≤ 1000) each — the time in minutes needed to complete the i-th task and its interest value.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer — the maximum possible total interest value of all the tasks in the quest.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5\n1 1\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n5 5\n4 1\n4 2\n4 3\n4 4\n4 5\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n2 2\n1 1\n2 10\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test all the five tasks can be complemented with four questions and joined into one quest.\n\nIn the second sample test it is impossible to use all the five tasks, but you can take two of them, the most interesting ones.\n\nIn the third sample test the optimal strategy is to include only the second task into the quest.\n\nHere is the picture that illustrates the answers to the sample tests. The blue circles represent the questions, the two arrows that go from every circle represent where a person goes depending on his answer to that question. The tasks are the red ovals.

{"name": "2183", "description": "We start with a string $s$ consisting only of the digits $1$, $2$, or $3$. The length of $s$ is denoted by $|s|$. For each $i$ from $1$ to $|s|$, the $i$-th character of $s$ is denoted by $s_i$. \n\nThere is one cursor. The cursor's location $\\ell$ is denoted by an integer in $\\{0, \\ldots, |s|\\}$, with the following meaning:   If $\\ell = 0$, then the cursor is located before the first character of $s$.  If $\\ell = |s|$, then the cursor is located right after the last character of $s$.  If $0 < \\ell < |s|$, then the cursor is located between $s_\\ell$ and $s_{\\ell+1}$. \n\nWe denote by $s_\\text{left}$ the string to the left of the cursor and $s_\\text{right}$ the string to the right of the cursor. \n\nWe also have a string $c$, which we call our clipboard, which starts out as empty. There are three types of actions:  The Move action. Move the cursor one step to the right. This increments $\\ell$ once.  The Cut action. Set $c \\leftarrow s_\\text{right}$, then set $s \\leftarrow s_\\text{left}$.  The Paste action. Append the value of $c$ to the end of the string $s$. Note that this doesn't modify $c$. \n\nThe cursor initially starts at $\\ell = 0$. Then, we perform the following procedure:  Perform the Move action once.  Perform the Cut action once.  Perform the Paste action $s_\\ell$ times.  If $\\ell = x$, stop. Otherwise, return to step 1. \n\nYou're given the initial string $s$ and the integer $x$. What is the length of $s$ when the procedure stops? Since this value may be very large, only find it modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\nIt is guaranteed that $\\ell \\le |s|$ at any time.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le 10^6$). The second line of each test case consists of the initial string $s$ ($1 \\le |s| \\le 500$). It is guaranteed, that $s$ consists of the characters \"1\", \"2\", \"3\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $x$ in a single file is at most $10^6$.

Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23 and $c = $ 131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 2 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 3$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 231 and $c = $ 31131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 1 time: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 3 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 4$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2313 and $c = $ 1131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 4 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 5$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23131 and $c = $ 13113111311311131131.

Help Allen determine if he should bother parking his cars or leave it to someone less important.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$, $1 \\le k \\le 2n$), representing the number of columns and the number of cars, respectively.\n\nThe next four lines will contain $n$ integers each between $0$ and $k$ inclusive, representing the initial state of the parking lot. The rows are numbered $1$ to $4$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ to $n$ from left to right.\n\nIn the first and last line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents a parking spot assigned to car $x$ (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer $0$ represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place).\n\nIn the second and third line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents initial position of car $x$, while the integer $0$ represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place).\n\nEach $x$ between $1$ and $k$ appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most $20000$ car moves, then print $m$, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following $m$ lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format $i$ $r$ $c$, which corresponds to Allen moving car $i$ to the neighboring space at row $r$ and column $c$.\n\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most $20000$ car moves, print a single line with the integer $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n\nOutput\n6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car $5$, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent. The example shows the shortest possible sequence of moves, but any sequence of length at most $20000$ will be accepted.\n\nIn the second sample test case, there is only one column, and the cars are in the wrong order, so no cars can move and the task is impossible.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2047, "sample_io": [{"input": "4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n", "output": ["6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n", "output": ["2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n", "output": ["6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n", "output": ["2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n"]}, {"input": "2 2\n1 0\n0 2\n0 1\n0 2\n", "output": ["7\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n2 3 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 2\n1 1 1\n2 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "7 14\n2 11 1 14 9 8 5\n12 6 7 1 10 2 3\n14 13 9 8 5 4 11\n13 6 4 3 12 7 10\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "2 1\n0 0\n0 0\n0 1\n0 1\n", "output": ["1\n1 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "2 3\n0 2\n0 1\n3 2\n3 1\n", "output": ["7\n1 2 1\n2 2 2\n3 4 1\n1 3 1\n2 1 2\n1 3 2\n1 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n", "output": ["2\n1 3 1\n1 4 1\n"]}, {"input": "2 4\n3 4\n2 1\n3 4\n2 1\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "3 5\n2 1 5\n5 3 2\n4 0 1\n0 4 3\n", "output": ["18\n4 3 2\n5 3 1\n3 2 1\n2 2 2\n1 2 3\n4 4 2\n5 3 2\n3 3 1\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n5 3 3\n3 3 2\n2 1 1\n1 1 2\n5 2 3\n3 3 3\n5 1 3\n3 4 3\n"]}, {"input": "10 1\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["1\n1 1 3\n"]}, {"input": "50 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["34\n1 3 27\n1 3 28\n1 3 29\n1 3 30\n1 3 31\n1 3 32\n1 3 33\n1 3 34\n1 3 35\n1 3 36\n1 3 37\n1 3 38\n1 3 39\n1 3 40\n1 3 41\n1 3 42\n1 3 43\n1 3 44\n1 3 45\n1 3 46\n1 3 47\n1 3 48\n1 3 49\n1 3 50\n1 2 50\n1 2 49\n1 2 48\n1 2 47\n1 2 46\n1 2 45\n1 2 44\n1 2 43\n1 2 42\n1 1 42\n"]}, {"input": "22 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["65\n2 2 13\n1 3 21\n2 2 12\n1 3 22\n2 2 11\n1 2 22\n2 2 10\n1 2 21\n2 2 9\n1 2 20\n2 2 8\n1 2 19\n2 2 7\n1 2 18\n2 2 6\n1 2 17\n2 2 5\n1 2 16\n2 2 4\n1 2 15\n2 2 3\n1 2 14\n2 2 2\n1 2 13\n2 2 1\n1 2 12\n2 3 1\n1 2 11\n2 3 2\n1 2 10\n2 3 3\n1 2 9\n2 3 4\n1 2 8\n2 3 5\n1 2 7\n2 3 6\n1 2 6\n2 3 7\n1 2 5\n2 3 8\n1 2 4\n2 3 9\n1 2 3\n2 3 10\n1 2 2\n2 3 11\n1 2 1\n2 3 12\n1 3 1\n2 3 13\n1 3 2\n2 3 14\n1 3 3\n2 3 15\n1 3 4\n2 3 16\n1 3 5\n2 3 17\n1 3 6\n2 3 18\n1 3 7\n2 4 18\n1 3 8\n1 4 8\n"]}, {"input": "12 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 2 0\n", "output": ["38\n1 3 11\n3 3 7\n2 3 2\n1 3 12\n3 3 8\n2 3 3\n1 2 12\n3 3 9\n2 3 4\n1 2 11\n3 4 9\n2 3 5\n1 2 10\n2 3 6\n1 2 9\n2 3 7\n1 2 8\n2 3 8\n1 2 7\n2 3 9\n1 2 6\n2 3 10\n1 2 5\n2 3 11\n1 2 4\n2 4 11\n1 2 3\n1 2 2\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n1 3 2\n1 3 3\n1 3 4\n1 3 5\n1 3 6\n1 3 7\n1 3 8\n1 4 8\n"]}, {"input": "10 20\n18 9 4 5 12 14 16 1 15 20\n11 13 16 6 18 5 20 17 4 3\n12 9 15 14 8 10 2 19 1 7\n6 11 13 2 7 19 10 3 8 17\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "15 30\n20 24 17 13 26 8 5 6 27 14 18 22 25 2 15\n4 12 6 25 3 5 28 11 15 21 9 26 7 17 13\n19 20 24 16 2 23 8 29 22 30 1 27 10 14 18\n9 29 3 7 12 28 10 16 23 19 21 1 30 11 4\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}], "starter_code": ""}
{"name": "2144", "description": "Ujan has a lot of numbers in his boxes. He likes order and balance, so he decided to reorder the numbers.\n\nThere are $k$ boxes numbered from $1$ to $k$. The $i$-th box contains $n_i$ integer numbers. The integers can be negative. All of the integers are distinct. \n\nUjan is lazy, so he will do the following reordering of the numbers exactly once. He will pick a single integer from each of the boxes, $k$ integers in total. Then he will insert the chosen numbers — one integer in each of the boxes, so that the number of integers in each box is the same as in the beginning. Note that he may also insert an integer he picked from a box back into the same box.\n\nUjan will be happy if the sum of the integers in each box is the same. Can he achieve this and make the boxes perfectly balanced, like all things should be?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq 15$), the number of boxes. \n\nThe $i$-th of the next $k$ lines first contains a single integer $n_i$ ($1 \\leq n_i \\leq 5\\,000$), the number of integers in box $i$. Then the same line contains $n_i$ integers $a_{i,1}, \\ldots, a_{i,n_i}$ ($|a_{i,j}| \\leq 10^9$), the integers in the $i$-th box. \n\nIt is guaranteed that all $a_{i,j}$ are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Ujan cannot achieve his goal, output \"No\" in a single line. Otherwise in the first line output \"Yes\", and then output $k$ lines. The $i$-th of these lines should contain two integers $c_i$ and $p_i$. This means that Ujan should pick the integer $c_i$ from the $i$-th box and place it in the $p_i$-th box afterwards.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, output any of those.\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n3 1 7 4\n2 3 2\n2 8 5\n1 10\n\nOutput\nYes\n7 2\n2 3\n5 1\n10 4\n\nInput\n2\n2 3 -2\n2 -1 5\n\nOutput\nNo\n\nInput\n2\n2 -10 10\n2 0 -20\n\nOutput\nYes\n-10 2\n-20 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Ujan can put the number $7$ in the $2$nd box, the number $2$ in the $3$rd box, the number $5$ in the $1$st box and keep the number $10$ in the same $4$th box. Then the boxes will contain numbers $\\{1,5,4\\}$, $\\{3, 7\\}$, $\\{8,2\\}$ and $\\{10\\}$. The sum in each box then is equal to $10$.\n\nIn the second sample, it is not possible to pick and redistribute the numbers in the required way.\n\nIn the third sample, one can swap the numbers $-20$ and $-10$, making the sum in each box equal to $-10$.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2144, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n3 1 7 4\n2 3 2\n2 8 5\n1 10\n", "output": ["Yes\n7 2\n2 3\n5 1\n10 4\n"]}, {"input": "2\n2 3 -2\n2 -1 5\n", "output": ["No\n"]}, {"input": "2\n2 -10 10\n2 0 -20\n", "output": ["Yes\n-10 2\n-20 1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "4\n3 1 7 4\n2 3 2\n2 8 5\n1 10\n", "output": ["Yes\n7 2\n2 3\n5 1\n10 4\n"]}, {"input": "2\n2 3 -2\n2 -1 5\n", "output": ["No\n"]}, {"input": "2\n2 -10 10\n2 0 -20\n", "output": ["Yes\n-10 2\n-20 1\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1 0\n", "output": ["Yes\n0 1\n"]}, {"input": "3\n1 20\n2 30 40\n3 50 60 80\n", "output": ["No\n"]}, {"input": "3\n3 1 3 100\n2 4 104\n2 2 102\n", "output": ["No\n"]}, {"input": "4\n3 80 1 10\n3 52 19 24\n3 27 46 29\n3 74 13 25\n", "output": ["No\n"]}, {"input": "2\n5 -1000000000 999999999 -999999998 999999997 0\n5 1000000000 -999999999 999999998 -999999997 4\n", "output": ["Yes\n0 2\n4 1\n"]}, {"input": "5\n10 -251 650 475 -114 364 -75754 -982 -532 -151 -484\n10 -623 -132 -317561 -438 20 -275 -323 -530089 -311 -587\n10 450900 -519 903 -401 -789 -606529 277 -267 -682 -161\n10 -246 873 -641 838 719 234 789 -74 -287288 -772972\n10 186 741 -927 -866 -855 578 -1057019 202 162962 -458\n", "output": ["Yes\n650 3\n-530089 1\n450900 5\n-287288 2\n162962 4\n"]}, {"input": "2\n2 1 2\n10 0 1000000000 999999999 999999998 999999997 999999996 999999995 999999994 999999993 589934621\n", "output": ["No\n"]}], "starter_code": ""}
